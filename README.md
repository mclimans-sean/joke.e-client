# jōke.ē

## Description
* jōke.ē is a single-page-app intended to simplify the project of putting together a comedy show for both the booker of the show as well as the comedic talent.

## Features
* Show bookers can create a show to be listed on jōke.ē.

* Comedians can see shows that are currently available & indicate if they're interested in performing.

* Show bookers can see what comedians are interested in performing, but also create a "Wish-list" of comedians they would like to have on the show, but haven't given an indication of interest.

* Bookers & comedians can give a "heck yeah" to other comedians they have worked with as an endorsement that they do a good job & deserve to be booked.
